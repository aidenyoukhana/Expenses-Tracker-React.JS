This is an expense tracker web application that was developed primarily using JavaScript. 

The web app is designed using HTML/CSS basic layouts. 

This application took an expense name, amount, and date and loges into the screen for the user.

There were multiple exceptions thrown in case input argument is illegal.

Definitely one of the most interesting applications that I have developed lately.
